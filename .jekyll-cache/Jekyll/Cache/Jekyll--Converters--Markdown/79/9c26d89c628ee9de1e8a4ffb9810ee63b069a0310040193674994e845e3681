<p>I am a <a href="https://history.virginia.edu/people/profile/csk5vf">doctoral candidate</a> at the University of Virginia. My teaching and scholarship examine the history of
    religion, politics, and culture in the United States. I am also interested in anti-racist pedagogy and digital history. I received my master’s degree in History and a
    graduate certificate in American Studies from UVA and my bachelor’s degree in History from Yale University. My dissertation, “<a href="projects.html">Faith Networks: National Broadcasting
    and the Making of American Religion</a>,” explores religion and mass culture during the supposed “Golden Age” of radio.
I have written for various publications including the <em>Yale Historical Review</em>, <em>Methodist Review</em>, and <em>Christian Century</em>. I have also received an “Accept with Revisions” for an article in <em>Modern American History</em>. I am thankful to <a href="cv.html#cv-grants">organizations that have supported my work</a> including the American Historical Association,
    the Renate Voris Fellowship Foundation, the American Jewish Historical Society, and the American Society of Church History. I also serve as the Editor of <a href="http://essaysinhistory.com"><em>Essays in History</em></a>, an open access journal for emerging historians.</p>

<p> In my spare time, I love singing and exploring the outdoors. I am especially fond of kayaking the Greenbrier River in my home state of
        West Virginia. On weekends you can often find me helping out (or at least eating!) at my wife's bakery, <a href="https://bowerbirdbakeshop.com/our-team">Bowerbird Bakeshop.</a>
