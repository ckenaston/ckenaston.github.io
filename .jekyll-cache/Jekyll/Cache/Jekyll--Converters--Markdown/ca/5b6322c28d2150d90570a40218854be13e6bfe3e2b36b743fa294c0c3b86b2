<p>In the last few years, I have come to realize how digital tools can help historians like me to analyze the past in new and interesting ways. As a Praxis fellow, I want to learn more about whatâ€™s out there. What digital tools could I use to augment my teaching and research? And what are the implications of using those tools?</p>

<p>But the truth is, for much of my life I described myself as â€œnot a tech person.â€ Whenever friends would talk about computers, Iâ€™d find myself struggling to follow and soon my brain would begin to wander.</p>

<p>As a late-blooming â€œtech person,â€ I find myself especially susceptible to self-doubt. Though Iâ€™ve found the Scholarsâ€™ Lab to be a warm and welcoming community, during the first few weeks of Praxis I have continued to question my ability to keep up. Am I asking a stupid question? Does everyone else already understand this concept? Can I actually complete this coding homework?</p>

<p>I found myself asking that last question during our first coding assignment. The assignment was to create a program in Python that would translate a word into Pig-Latin. I didnâ€™t know where to start. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck beginning to rise. I was going to be found out as â€œnot a tech person,â€ and it was only Week 2.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Shane had suggested working in partners, and my new friend Janet had some great ideas about how to get started. Though it took more than a few tries, Janet and I eventually came up with a code to successfully perform the task. Hufflepuff, you say? How about ufflepuffHay? I was proud that I had suggested using the input functionâ€”an intervention that helped make the breakthrough. Maybe I could do this after all?</p>

<p>Having sipped the nectar of possibility, I found myself creating other simple programs in my free time. For instance, I created a program that asks the question every PhD student gets all too often: â€œHowâ€™s your dissertation coming?â€ After you inevitably write something like â€œOh, not great actuallyâ€”Iâ€™m really struggling to write,â€ the program replies with a piece of advice from Yoda such as, â€œDo or do notâ€”there is no try!â€ or â€œThat is why you failâ€ or perhaps something more uplifting like â€œPatience you must have young Padawanâ€ or â€œMay the force be with you!â€ I found myself chuckling every time the program spit back a response. Having learned about codersâ€™ sense of humor, the program felt like my â€œHello, World!â€ to this new galaxy of digital humanities.</p>

<p>One of my personal goals as a Praxis Fellow this year is to shed any lingering traces of my â€œIâ€™m not a tech personâ€ mentality. â€œYou must unlearn what you have learned,â€ Yoda might say.</p>

<p>It wonâ€™t be easy. Iâ€™m sure this past week wonâ€™t be the last time self-doubt creeps back. But hey, who wants a year without a little adventure? Hit it, John Williams!</p>
