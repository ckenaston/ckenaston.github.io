I am a [doctoral candidate](https://history.virginia.edu/people/profile/csk5vf) at the University of Virginia. My teaching and scholarship examine the history of religion, politics, and culture in the United States. I am also interested in anti-racist pedagogy and digital history. I received my master’s degree in History and a graduate certificate in American Studies from UVA and my bachelor’s degree in History from Yale University. My dissertation, “[Faith Networks: National Broadcasting and the Making of American Religion](projects.html),” explores religion and mass culture during the supposed “Golden Age” of radio. My writing has appeared in [various publications](cv.html#cv-publications) including the _Yale Historical Review_, _Methodist Review_, and _Christian Century_. I recently received an “Accept with Revisions” for an article to be published in _Modern American History_. [Various organizations have supported my work](cv.html#cv-grants) including the American Historical Association, the Renate Voris Fellowship Foundation, the American Jewish Historical Society, and the American Society of Church History. I also serve as the Editor of [_Essays in History_](http://essaysinhistory.com), an open access journal for emerging historians.

In my spare time, I love singing and exploring the outdoors. I am especially fond of kayaking the Greenbrier River in my home state of West Virginia. On weekends you can often find me helping out (or at least eating!) at my wife’s bakery, [Bowerbird Bakeshop.](https://bowerbirdbakeshop.com/our-team)
