Connor S. Kenaston is an [Assistant Professor of History](https://www.randolphcollege.edu/news/2022/09/21207/) at Randolph College. His teaching and scholarship examine the history of the United States and the Atlantic World. He specializes in 20th century social and cultural history, American religious history, and critical pedagogy. Connor received his PhD in History from the University of Virginia in 2022. He also holds an M.A. in History with a graduate certificate in American Studies from the University of Virginia and a B.A. in History from Yale University. His current book project, “[The Big Three: Commercial Radio Networks and the Making of Tri-Faith America](projects.html),” examines the history of religion and radio in the American century. His article, "[Step by Step: American Interracialism and the Origins of Talk-First Activism](https://doi.org/10.1017/mah.2022.2)," was published in _Modern American History_ in 2022. His scholarship has also featured in publications such as _Hybrid Pedagogy_, _Methodist Review_, _Yale Historical Review_, _Christian Century_, and _Reviews in Digital Humanities_. His work has been supported by organizations including the American Historical Association, the Renate Voris Fellowship Foundation, the American Jewish Historical Society, and the American Society of Church History.

Connor's favorite thing to do outside of the classroom is to go hiking with his wife Maria and dog, Franklin. He also enjoys singing, going to the theatre, playing soccer and tennis, and cheering on Manchester United. In the summertime, you're most likely to find Connor kayaking on the Greenbrier River back in his home state of West Virginia -- or wishing he was there!
