## Experience

For my previous teaching experience, see my [curriculum vitae](cv.html#teaching).

## Philosophy

My first priority as a teacher is to create an inclusive learning community where all students can thrive. I try to always lead with compassion and a deep sense that both _what_ we are learning and _how_ we are learning matters. I structure my courses so that my diverse students can see themselves reflected in the material and have low-stakes opportunities to develop skills needed to do well in the course.  I also employ specific pedagogical techniques to ensure that students feel comfortable contributing and have practice integrating knowledge from our class into the rest of their lives. These strategies combine to create a learning environment where students will gain the skills and confidence to succeed in college and beyond.
