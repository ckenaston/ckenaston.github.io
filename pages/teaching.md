## Philosophy

In my classroom, both _what_ we are learning and _how_ we are learning matters. My first priority is to cultivate a democratic community where students become active participants in the learning process. I design fully accessible courses that prioritize improvement, engaging diverse perspectives, and teaching students to think like historians. My goal is that any course I teach will be part of a student’s lifelong journey of becoming a deep thinker and responsible citizen.

## Publications about Teaching

“[With Care and Context](https://hybridpedagogy.org/with-care-and-context/),” _Hybrid Pedagogy_, June 17, 2021. In this article, I reflect on viewing lynching photographs as an undergraduate student and how my thinking about the merits of teaching with such images has evolved over time.
