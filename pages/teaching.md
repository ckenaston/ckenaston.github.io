## Philosophy

In my classroom, both _what_ we are learning and _how_ we are learning matters. My first priority as a teacher is to create a learning environment where students feel that they belong. I design courses so that students engage diverse media and perspectives, and I work to cultivate community and active learning in the classroom. These techniques help students learn, as one put it, “To always reflect on the historical path that has shaped many aspects of our lives today, to think of events as a contingent process and to learn from the past in building the future.” My goal is that any course I teach will be a small step on a student’s lifelong journey of becoming a deep thinker and responsible citizen.

## Publications about Teaching

“[With Care and Context](https://hybridpedagogy.org/with-care-and-context/),” _Hybrid Pedagogy_, June 17, 2021. In this article, I reflect on viewing lynching photographs as an undergraduate student and how my thinking about the merits of teaching with such images has evolved over time.

## Sample Syllabi

This is the syllabus I used for "[American History Since 1865](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vT8PyDJp56nDRcqXNjMallt9QP1kxwRjxRUB3idqA68/edit?usp=sharing)," a course I taught at the University of Virginia during the summer of 2021.
