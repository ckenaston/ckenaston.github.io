**Who gets to play—and who decides?**

These two questions are at the heart of ongoing debates about women’s athletics, from the Olympics all the way to college campuses like Randolph.

Fortunately, for those who want to think critically about these questions, we have one of the foremost scholarly authorities right here in Lynchburg.

I was reminded of this last summer while listening to the podcast [Tested](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/1733-tested), produced by the CBC and NPR, in the lead up to the Summer Olympics in Paris. While listening, I heard a familiar voice – that of Dr. Lindsay Parks Pieper. 

I found this very exciting because I knew Dr. Pieper personally – we’d met playing pickleball. She’s tall and a former college athlete... so I’ll casually avoid telling you who usually won. 

As I listened, I became increasingly convinced that we needed to invite Dr. Pieper to campus.  I initially invited her to speak with my American Women’s History class, but word spread—and her visit turned into a campus-wide event. In the end, about 75 Wildcats showed up for her talk.

Lindsay Pieper is the Associate Professor of Health Sciences & Human Performance and the Chair of the Sport Management Department at the University of Lynchburg. She graduated with her BA from Virginia Tech and later received her Masters and Doctorate from The Ohio State University. 

Her book, [_Sex Testing: Gender Policing in Women’s Sport_](https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p081682), was published by the University of Illinois Press in 2016. It won several awards including the North American Society for Sport Sociology’s Outstanding Book of the Year, the North American Society for Sport History’s Distinguished Title award, and it was listed as an Outstanding Academic Title by the American Library Association. 

Her talk, “Sport, Sex, and Surveillance: Gender Policing in Women’s Sports," was timely, thought-provoking, and a resounding success.
