title: News about the American Culture Program
---

Check out this great new article about my time leading the [American Culture Program](https://www.randolphcollege.edu/news/2024/05/american-culture-program-explores-labor-leisure-and-music-in-the-u-s/).

Leading the American Culture Program for the last two years has been a blast! The program is unique to Randolph College and is a great example of what makes Randolph special -- small classes, experiential learning, and focused on ideas that matter.

For the last two years, we explored the intersection of labor, leisure, and music in the US. We traveled across town in Lynchburg, as well as to Charlottesville, DC, Knoxville, the Highlander Folk School, Memphis, and Nashville and met some amazing labor organizers, activists, musicians, politicians, scholars, and more! We also watched some amazing films, read some great books and articles, and had some great conversations. I think our theme, "Working for the Weekend," provided us all with a great opportunity to reflect on what we want from our lives and how we can help make the world we want to live in. But it was also a lot of fun -- I often described the American Culture Program as a neat opportunity to design my own "nerd vacation."

Huge shoutout to my wonderful colleague Julio Rodriguez, our logistics expert Luisa Carrera, and to two great cohorts of students. And a massive thanks to the MANY people who we met with and learned from over the last two years.
