title: Presenting "The Greatest Story" at the 2024 Meeting of the Business History Conference
---

A few years back, I spent a few days at the University of Akron library digging into the Advertising Files of the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. I wanted to learn more about "Greatest Story Ever Told," a religious radio program from the late 1940s and early 1950s that was later made into a TV program and a biblical epic. When _Greatest Story_ emerged in 1947, it differed from all other religious radio programs at that time because it was sponsored by a commercial company.

As I was looking through Goodyear's records, I came across several speeches and letters where Goodyear officials explained why they thought sponsoring a religious radio program was a good idea for their business. I was struck by how Goodyear used the tools of the advertising industry (eg, case studies, surveys, ratings, etc) along with an interfaith religious advisory committee (kind of like [this one from the Coen brothers'_Hail Caesar!_](https://youtu.be/KJEiDRi4Itc)) to tell the story of the Christian New Testament in a way that appealed to the mass market. As I was looking through the archive, I remember thinking, "Wow! I don't know how to make sense of this yet, but this is really interesting!" Not long after that archive visit, however, I realized I needed to wrap up my dissertation prior to the start of WWII. So I set my findings on Goodyear and _The Greatest Story_ aside. 

I decided to return to those materials this fall, however. I wanted to test the waters to see if I wanted to stretch the timeline of _The Big Three_ into the 1940s. I co-pitched a panel called "The Business of National Patrimony" to be presented at the Business History Conference in Providence, RI. My wonderful co-presenters were [Dael Norwood](https://www.history.udel.edu/people/faculty/dnorwood) and [Whitney Martinko](https://www.whitneymartinko.com/), and we were lucky to have [Wendy Woloson](https://sites.rutgers.edu/wendy-woloson/) as our commeter and [Seth Rockman](https://history.brown.edu/people/seth-e-rockman) as our panel chair. Shout-out to Dael for doing most of the legwork in regards to getting the panel together! 

My paper, "The Greatest Story: Commercial Radio and Religion in the American Century," argued that _Greatest Story Ever Told_ helped facilitate the rise of an imagined liberal consensus on religion during the Cold Year. At the same time, I also showed how the program's well-publicizied innovative sponsorship model helped convince the FCC that commercial program could serve the public interest, leading to a foundational 1960 FCC ruling that enabled the rise of televangelism. I received some excellent feedback from both Dr. Woloson and from the audience that will help me revise.

This was my first time attending the Business History Conference, and I really enjoyed it. Special thanks to Randolph College's Professional Development Committee for supporting my trip to Providence!
