title: Review of _Dixie Heretic_ by Tennant McWilliams
---


My review of _Dixie Heretic: The Civil Rights Odyssey of Renwick C. Kennedy_ by the late Tennant McWilliams is in the December 2024 issue of the _Journal of American History_! The book is a deeply researched biography of white Southern minister Renwick Kennedy and his (often unsuccessful) efforts to change his fellow white Christiansâ€™ attitudes about race and poverty.
