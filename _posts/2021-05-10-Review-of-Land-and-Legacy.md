title: Review of Land and Legacy
---

[_Land and Legacy_](https://landandlegacy.scholarslab.org/), a digital project I co-created, was recently reviewed in the May edition of [Reviews in Digital Humanities](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/pub/land-and-legacy/release/3).

In their review, Claire. A Tratnyek of Northeastern University made a number of astute observations about the project. I appreciated Tratnyek’s insights and generosity. Here’s a brief excerpt:

_“In both form and content, Land and Legacy is an exemplar of collaborative research and the integration of digital and
traditional historical methods. As scholars and citizens across the United States continue to uncover and confront the
difficult histories of our localities, this kind of project can provide us with new vocabularies for interdisciplinary
thinking and integrated storytelling — without sacrificing rigor or eliding uncomfortable questions.”_

Reading Tratnyek’s generous review reminded me of how thankful I was to have such incredible project collaborators: Janet S Dunkelbarger,
Natasha Roth-Rowland, Lauren Van Nest, and Chloe Down Wells. Working with such wonderful colleagues (and now friends!) definitely makes me want
to do more collaborative scholarship in the future. Tratnyek’s review also made me super appreciative of the [Scholars’ Lab](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/) community at UVA,
my time with the [Praxis Program](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/praxis-program-fellowships/), and all the [incredible people at UVA and around town](https://landandlegacy.scholarslab.org/about.html) who helped us out along the way!
You can read more about the specific roles I played on this website's [Projects page](projects.html#land-and-legacy).

Finally, I want to note how cool it felt to have _Land and Legacy_ reviewed alongside other great digital projects like “[Mapping Marronage](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/pub/mapping-marronage/release/3?readingCollection=d112edcc),” “[GeoNewsMiner](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/pub/geonewsminer/release/2?readingCollection=d112edcc),”
and “[Visualizing Objects, Spaces, and Places](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/pub/visualizing-objects-places-and-spaces/release/2?readingCollection=d112edcc).” If you’re not following _Reviews in Digital Humanities_, you should be!
