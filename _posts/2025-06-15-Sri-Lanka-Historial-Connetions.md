title: Research Historcal Connections Between Sri Lanka and the US
---

This year, I was honored to be selected for the Quillian International Scholar  
Study Abroad Seminar in Sri Lanka.

Last year, Randolph was fortunate to host Sri Lankan scholar Sudesh Mantillake  
as our Quillian Visiting International Scholar. I got to know him over the  
course of the year—his office was just down the hall from mine—and I was  
especially impressed by his  
[performance of Kandyan dance in February](https://www.randolphcollege.edu/news/2025/06/connecting-cultures-randolphs-quillian-visiting-international-scholar-shares-sri-lankan-heritage/),  
an event attended by the Sri Lankan ambassador.

Throughout the spring, the Randolph delegation followed a rigorous preparation  
schedule. We attended weekly information sessions on Sri Lankan history,  
religion, culture, and food, and many of us visited the Sri Lankan Embassy in D.C.

I also used this time to begin researching historical connections between the  
U.S. and Sri Lanka.

The first thing I discovered was that Sudesh was _not_ the first Sri Lankan to  
perform Kandyan dance at Randolph! The R-MWC newspaper, _The Sun Dial_,  
reported that two members of the Ceylon National Dancers performed here in 1962.  
When I showed the image to Sudesh, he was blown away—the male dancer had been  
one of his mentors!

That discovery led me to wonder: Had Sri Lanka played a role in American  
religious history?

I started with the 1932 Hocking Report, titled _Re-Thinking Missions: A Laymen's  
Inquiry After One Hundred Years_. I had first encountered it in David  
Hollinger’s [_Protestants Abroad_](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691158433/protestants-abroad?srsltid=AfmBOoqMZHrb-KVMCJ4ig-CLvMgIY7xjAiws1AfmzdSHOs7IwdkuJ3Di),  
which highlights its pivotal role in reshaping Protestant missions and American  
Protestantism more broadly.

As a former Global Mission Fellow of the United Methodist Church—here’s my  
[blog](https://ckenaston.wordpress.com/) and  
[podcast](https://www.moumethodist.org/faithandracepodcast) from those years—this made total sense to me.

> Why did I grow up with such a radically different understanding of "mission"  
> and even "missionary" than many evangelicals?  
> One big reason is the Hocking Report.

I discovered that the committee did indeed travel to Ceylon as part of their  
research. However, I wasn’t able to find any digitized sources detailing their  
time there. Ah well!

A bit more internet digging led me to Howard Thurman as another possible link  
between American religious history and Sri Lanka.

I had read Thurman’s _Jesus and the Disinherited_ in grad school and knew how  
deeply it had been shaped by his 1935 journey to India. During that trip, he met  
with Gandhi and helped forge a spiritual and intellectual link between Gandhian  
nonviolence and the American civil rights movement.

I also knew that his papers had been digitized through Boston University’s  
[Howard Thurman Papers Project](https://www.bu.edu/htpp/).

What I quickly discovered was that Thurman didn’t just travel to India—he also  
spent time in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Burma (Myanmar).

As I dug into his journal from his time in Ceylon, I began to see that Sri Lanka  
played a far more crucial role in shaping his ideas than I had realized.

I presented a paper on this research titled  
**“Transformative Travel: Howard Thurman’s Pilgrimage to Ceylon and the Making of  
the U.S. Civil Rights Movement.”**

Since I don’t anticipate publishing this research formally, I’m sharing the  
[presentation text here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WXauPByKzvAiWNaSYH-93svzkaYxFb7PSM3DoGabRow/edit?usp=sharing).
