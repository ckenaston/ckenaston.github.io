title: Preparing to Teach Queer American History
---

This past year, I received support from the Ruth Borker Fund for Women's Studies to develop a new course on Queer History at Randolph College. Named in honor of a former Randolph professor, the Borker Fund supports faculty efforts to integrate "gender-related perspectives into the curriculum."

When I first arrived at Randolph, I didn’t anticipate teaching Queer History. But over the past three years, I’ve become convinced that such a course is essential. While I wasn’t formally trained in queer theory or LGBTQ history, I am a social historian committed to centering the experiences of underrepresented groups. In that spirit, I’ve worked to incorporate LGBTQIA+ stories into all of my classes. The student response has been powerful. Many have described this as a “secret” history—one that resonates deeply with their lives and experiences. The need for this course has only grown more urgent amid the [current wave of erasure of LGBTQ+ history](https://www.historians.org/perspectives-article/confronting-the-rainbow-panic/).

With support from the Borker Fund, I traveled to San Francisco this summer to visit key historical sites. The first day, I visited the Tenderloin neighborhood to check out the [Tenderloin Museum](https://www.tenderloinmuseum.org/), the former site of Compton's Cafeteria, and [Glide Memorial Church](https://www.nps.gov/places/glide-memorial-church.htm). I also traveled to Golden Gate Park to walk through the [National Aids Memorial Grove](https://www.aidsmemorial.org/). I spent the next day in the Castro. I visited the [GLBT Historical Society Museum](https://www.glbthistory.org/)—the first stand-alone LGBTQ history museum in the U.S-and joined an LGBTQ+ history - themed walking tour. As part of the tour, I visited the Castro Camera, Harvey Milk Plaza, Pink Triangle Memorial, Castro Theatre, and the Rainbow Honor Walk. On my final day, I ferried over to Angel Island State Park, where I was reminded of Margot Canaday’s work on how the federal government policed sexual identity through immigration policy.

The trip helped me think more intentionally about how to frame particular units and introduced new sources and stories -- such as the [Compton's Cafeteria Riot](https://youtu.be/G-WASW9dRBU?feature=shared) -- that I plan to incorporate into the syllabus. I’m really looking forward to teaching the course this fall!
