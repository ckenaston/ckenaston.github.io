This fall I spearheaded and served as the de facto chair of the nonpartisan #RandolphVotes initiative. Our aim was to boost voter participation and foster civil discourse on campus during the 2024 Presidential election. #RandolphVotes ensured Randolph College fulfilled its obligation under section 487(a)(23) of the Higher Education Act to make a "good faith effort" to distribute voter registration forms to their students.

As part of our initiative, promoted voter registration, organized transportation ot the polls, hosting voter education events, and promoted voter information on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/randolphvotes?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@randolph_votes?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc).

In a democracy, civic engagement is essential. Electoral politics shape the well-being of our communities. As I said in [this interview](https://www.randolphcollege.edu/news/2024/09/randolph-votes-initiative-to-provide-information-resources-to-campus-community/), "participating in the democratic process is a vital way to maintain Randolph's mission to engage the world, live honorably, and experience life abundantly."

One person points to their shirt with their coat open to reveal the design. The hallway is decorated with framed photos and posters, and the atmosphere is cheerful and energetic."> </a>
