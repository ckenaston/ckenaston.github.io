title: Giving Tuesday with the Presybterian Historical Society
---

In 2020, I was chosen to receive a $2,500 Research Fellowship grant from the Presbyterian Historical Society. Unfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic delayed my trip to the archive. Thankfully, PHS was able to use my research funds to request digital scans from the archive. I completed my long-anticipated trip to the archive in January 2022. 

This past week, I participated in a panel discussion with other grant recipients to talk about my research and the impact of the PHS fellowship. You can read [an article about the event](https://www.pcusa.org/news/2022/11/28/phs-webinar-celebrates-research-fellows-for-giving/) or watch a [recording of the event](https://youtu.be/l_JhyuhZZKc). Perhaps most importantly, be sure to support the Presbyterian Historical Society and other libraries and archives this Giving Tuesday!
