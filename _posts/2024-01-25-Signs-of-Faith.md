---

This week, I had the pleasure of hosting my dear friend, Eric Martin, as he talked about some of the ideas in his new book about religious responses the Unite the Right Rally in Charllotesville in 2017. The event went exceedingly well, and I encourage all of you to buy _[The Writing on the Wall](https://wipfandstock.com/9781666759099/the-writing-on-the-wall/)_, published by Wipf and Stock publishers.

<img class= "headshot" src="Images/faith_against.jpg" alt="Poster for Signs of Faith Against Fascism in Charlottesville. Includes a photograph of clergy protesting against the Unite the Right Rally. Text says: Signs of Faith Against Fascism in Charlottesville. With Theologian and Activist, Dr. Eric Martin. Jan. 25. 4:30 PM. Houston Memorial Chapel. Free & open to the public. How can people of faith connect their religious traditions with the rise of overtly fascist violence in the United States? Drawing on first-hand accounts from the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, this lecture will explore how the clergy who resisted Nazis and the KKK point a way forward for Christians in particular. It expands outward to ask what the faithful can learn from antifascists, Black Lives Matter, and other grassroots activists. Eric Martin teaches on the Bible, spirituality, and liberation movements at UCLA and Loyola Marymount. He is the author of The Writing on the Wall: Signs of Faith Against Fascism and co-editor of The Berrigan Letters. Co-sponsored by the Randolph College Department of History, Department of Comparative Philosophy, and Campus Events Committee.">
