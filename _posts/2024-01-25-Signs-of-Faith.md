title: Signs of Faith Against Fascism
---

This week, I had the pleasure of hosting my dear friend, Eric Martin, as he talked about some of the ideas in his new book about religious responses the Unite the Right Rally in Charllotesville in 2017. The event went exceedingly well, and I encourage all of you to buy _[The Writing on the Wall](https://wipfandstock.com/9781666759099/the-writing-on-the-wall/)_, published by Wipf and Stock publishers.
